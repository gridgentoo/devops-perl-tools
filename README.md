### DevOps Perl Tools

#### Hadoop, Hive, Solr, NoSQL, Web, Linux Tools ###

A few of the Hadoop, NoSQL, Web & Linux tools I've written over the years. All programs have --help to list the available options.

For many more tools see [DevOps Python Tools](https://github.com/harisekhon/devops-python-tools) and the [Advanced Nagios Plugins Collection](https://github.com/harisekhon/nagios-plugins) which contains many more Hadoop, NoSQL and Linux/Web tools.

##### Make sure you run ```make update``` if updating and not just ```git pull``` as you will often need the latest library submodule and possibly new upstream libraries. #####

### Quick Start ###

#### Ready to run Docker image #####

All programs and their pre-compiled dependencies can be found ready to run on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/harisekhon/tools/).

List all programs:
```
docker run harisekhon/tools
```
Run any given program:
```
docker run harisekhon/tools <program> <args>
```

#### Automated Build from source #####

```
git clone https://github.com/harisekhon/devops-perl-tools tools
cd tools
make
```

The 'make' command will initialize my library submodule and  use 'sudo' to install the required system packages and CPAN modules. If you want more control over what is installed you must follow the [Manual Setup](https://github.com/harisekhon/devops-perl-tools#manual-setup) section instead.

Make sure to read [Detailed Build Instructions](https://github.com/HariSekhon/devops-perl-tools#detailed-build-instructions) further down for more information.

### Usage ###

All programs come with a ```--help``` switch which includes a program description and the list of command line options.

Environment variables are supported for convenience and also to hide credentials from being exposed in the process list eg. ```$PASSWORD```. These are indicated in the ```--help``` descriptions in brackets next to each option and often have more specific overrides with higher precedence eg. ```$SOLR_HOST``` takes priority over ```$HOST```.


### Tools

##### NOTE: Hadoop HDFS API Tools, Pig => Elasticsearch/Solr, Pig Jython UDFs and authenticated PySpark IPython Notebook have moved to my [DevOps Python Tools](https://github.com/harisekhon/devops-python-tools) repo. #####

- Linux:
  - ```anonymize.pl``` - anonymizes your configs / logs from files or stdin (for pasting to Apache Jira tickets or mailing lists)
    - anonymizes:
      - hostnames / domains / FQDNs
      - email addresses
      - IP + MAC addresses
      - Kerberos principals
      - Cisco & Juniper ScreenOS configurations passwords, shared keys and SNMP strings
    - ```anonymize_custom.conf``` - put regex of your Name/Company/Project/Database/Tables to anonymize to ```<custom>```
    - placeholder tokens indicate what was stripped out (eg. ```<fqdn>```, ```<password>```, ```<custom>```)
    - ```--ip-prefix``` leaves the last IP octect to aid in cluster debugging to still see differentiated nodes communicating with each other to compare configs and log communications
  - ```sqlcase.pl``` - capitalizes SQL code in files or stdin:
    - ```*case.pl``` - more specific language support for Hive, Impala, Cassandra CQL, Couchbase N1QL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Apache Drill, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, Pig Latin, Neo4j, InfluxDB and Docker
    - written to help clean up docs and SQL scripts (I don't even bother writing capitalised SQL code any more I just run it through this via a vim shortcut)
  - ```diffnet.pl``` - simplifies diff output to show only lines added/removed, not moved, from patch files or stdin (pipe from standard diff command)
  - ```xml_diff.pl``` / ```hadoop_config_diff.pl``` - tool to help find differences between XML / Hadoop configs, can diff XML from HTTP addresses to diff live running clusters
  - ```titlecase.pl``` - capitalizes the first letter of each input word in files or stdin
  - ```pdf_to_txt.pl``` - converts PDF to text for analytics (see also [Apache PDFBox](https://pdfbox.apache.org/) and pdf2text unix tool)
  - ```java_show_classpath.pl``` - shows java classpaths of a running Java program in a sane way
  - ```flock.pl``` - file locking to prevent running the same program twice at the same time. RHEL 6 now has a native version of this
  - ```uniq_order_preserved.pl``` - like `uniq` but you don't have to sort first and it preserves the ordering
  - ```colors.pl``` - prints ASCII color code matrix fg/bg with corresponding terminal escape codes to help with tuning your shell
  - ```matrix.pl``` - prints a cool matrix of vertical scrolling characters using terminal tricks
  - ```welcome.pl``` - cool spinning welcome message greeting your username and showing last login time and user to put in your shell's ```.profile``` (there is also a python version in my [DevOps Python Tools](https://github.com/harisekhon/devops-python-tools) repo)

- Web:
  - ```watch_url.pl``` - watches a given url, outputting status code and optionally selected output, useful for debugging web farms behind load balancers and seeing the distribution to different servers (tip: set a /hostname handler to return which server you're hitting for each request in real-time)
  - ```watch_nginx_stats.pl``` - watches nginx stats via the HttpStubStatusModule module

- Hadoop Ecosystem:
  - ```ambari_freeipa_kerberos_setup.pl``` - Automates Hadoop cluster security Kerberos setup of FreeIPA principals and keytab distribution to the cluster nodes. Designed for Hortonworks HDP but now that other vendors such as IBM and Pivotal are standarizing on Ambari it should work the same for those distributions as well.
  - ```hadoop_hdfs_file_age_out.pl``` - prints or removes all HDFS files in a given directory tree older than a specified age
  - ```hadoop_hdfs_snapshot_age_out.pl``` - prints or removes HDFS snapshots older than a given age or matching a given regex pattern
  - ```hbase_flush_tables.sh``` - flushes all or selected HBase tables (useful when bulk loading OpenTSDB with Durability.SKIP_WAL) (there is also a Python version of this in my [DevOps Python Tools](https://github.com/harisekhon/devops-python-tools) repo)
  - ```hive_to_elasticsearch.pl``` - bulk indexes structured Hive tables in Hadoop to Elasticsearch clusters - includes support for Kerberos, Hive partitioned tables with selected partitions, selected columns, index creation with configurable sharding, index aliasing and optimization
  - ```hive_table_print_null_columns.pl``` - finds Hive columns with all NULLs
  - ```hive_table_count_rows_with_nulls.pl``` - counts number of rows containing NULLs in any field
  - ```pentaho_backup.pl``` - script to back up the local Pentaho BA or DI Server
  - ```ibm_bigsheets_config_git.pl``` - revision controls IBM BigSheets configurations from API to Git
  - ```datameer_config_git.pl``` - revision controls Datameer configurations from API to Git
  - ```hadoop_config_diff.pl``` - tool to diff configs between Hadoop clusters XML from files or live HTTP config endpoints
  - ```solr_cli.pl``` - Solr CLI tool for fast and easy Solr / SolrCloud administration. Supports optional environment variables to minimize --switches (can be set permanently in `solr/solr-env.sh`). Uses the Solr Cores and Collections APIs, makes Solr administration a lot easier


### Detailed Build Instructions

##### Perlbrew localized installs

The automated build will use 'sudo' to install required Perl CPAN libraries to the system unless running as root or it detects being inside Perlbrew. If you want to install some of the common Perl libraries such as Net::DNS and LWP::* using your OS packages instead of installing from CPAN then follow the Manual Build section below.


#### Manual Setup ####

Enter the tools directory and run git submodule init and git submodule update to fetch my library repo and then install the CPAN modules as mentioned further down:

```
git clone https://github.com/harisekhon/devops-perl-tools tools
cd tools
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Then proceed to install the CPAN modules below by hand.


###### CPAN Modules ######

Install the following CPAN modules using the cpan command, using sudo if you're not root:

```
sudo cpan JSON LWP::Simple LWP::UserAgent Term::ReadKey Text::Unidecode Time::HiRes XML::LibXML XML::Validate ...
```

The full list of CPAN modules is in ```setup/cpan-requirements.txt```.

You can install the entire list of cpan requirements like so:

```
sudo cpan $(sed 's/#.*//' < setup/cpan-requirements.txt)
```

You're now ready to use these programs.


#### Offline Setup

Download the Tools and Lib git repos as zip files:

https://github.com/HariSekhon/devops-perl-tools/archive/master.zip

https://github.com/HariSekhon/lib/archive/master.zip

Unzip both and move Lib to the ```lib``` folder under Tools.

```
unzip devops-perl-tools-master.zip
unzip lib-master.zip

mv -v devops-perl-tools-master tools
mv -v lib-master lib
mv -vf lib tools/
```

Proceed to install CPAN modules for whichever programs you want to use using your standard procedure - usually an internal mirror or proxy server to CPAN, or rpms / debs (some libraries are packaged by Linux distributions).

All CPAN modules are listed in the ```setup/cpan-requirements.txt``` file.


#### Configuration for Strict Domain / FQDN validation ####

Strict validations include host/domain/FQDNs using TLDs which are populated from the official IANA list. This is done via my [Lib](https://github.com/harisekhon/lib) submodule - see there for details on configuring this to permit custom TLDs like ```.local``` or ```.intranet``` (both supported by default).


### Updating ###

Run ```make update```. This will git pull and then git submodule update which is necessary to pick up corresponding library updates.

If you update often and want to just quickly git pull + submodule update but skip rebuilding all those dependencies each time then run ```make update-no-recompile``` (will miss new library dependencies - do full ```make update``` if you encounter issues).


### Testing

[Continuous Integration](https://travis-ci.org/HariSekhon/devops-perl-tools) is run on this repo with tests for success and failure scenarios:
- unit tests for the custom supporting [perl library](https://github.com/harisekhon/lib)
- integration tests of the top level programs using the libraries for things like option parsing
- [functional tests](https://github.com/HariSekhon/devops-perl-tools/tree/master/tests) for the top level programs using local test data and [Docker containers](https://hub.docker.com/u/harisekhon/)

To trigger all tests run:

```
make test
```

which will start with the underlying libraries, then move on to top level integration tests and functional tests using docker containers if docker is available.
